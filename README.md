# Adrenaline

This is an issues-only repository for Adrenaline, an **intelligent system for answering programming questions.**

Please feel free to create issues for bugs or feature requests –– it's much appreciated. Your feedback will directly impact how Adrenaline improves over time.

## Getting started

Try asking a question on the [Adrenaline website.](https://useadrenaline.com/)

## Features

Our goal is to answer _any_ technical question. Right now, this includes questions about:

* General programming concepts
* Any GitHub repository
* Any documentation website
* Code snippets

Adrenaline can also search the internet and base answers on relevant resources, employ reasoning algorithms to answer more complex questions, and even _generate diagrams_ to help explain things.
